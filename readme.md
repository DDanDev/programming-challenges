# Solutions to programming compretitive contest challenges

Most solutions were done in python.

For the solutions using javascript (with a bit more features for fun), visit https://ddandev.github.io/programming-challenges/

Challenges are from different sources, but mostly from beecrowd. I did not include all the challenge descriptions and criteria here. That would be too much for this readme, but might make a page for that in the future.
